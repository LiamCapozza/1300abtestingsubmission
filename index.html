        <h2>Project Intro</h2>
        <p>
          This A/B testing project tries to evaluate the user interactions of
          two different versions of a Doctor's appt. form. By comparing the two
          versions, A and B, we are looking for which version has better user
          interaction and efficiency.

      <div id="modifications">
        <h2>Webpage Modifications</h2>
        <p>
          I changed the layout of the appointments for Version B. I was aiming
          for better visibility and distinction between buttons and texts which
          would hopefully result in fewer misclicks and a faster experience.

        <h2>Metrics and Hypotheses</h2>
        <div class="metric">
          <h3>1. Misclick Rate</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Null Hypothesis:</strong> Version A of the form will have a
            very similar average misclick rate as Version B. I believe we will
            reject this hypothesis since Version A had buttons and text that are
            hard to see and differentiate from one another.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Alternative Hypothesis:</strong> Version B will have a lower
            average misclick rate than Version A. I believe this will be found
            true since the changes I made make it easier to see and
            differentiate different appointments from one another.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="metric">
          <h3>2. Time on Page</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Null Hypothesis:</strong>Version A will have a very similar
            average time on the page as Version B. I believe we will reject this
            hypothesis because Version A is confusing in how to exactly book an
            appointment, so the user will have to spend more time figuring out
            what to press.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Alternative Hypothesis:</strong> Version B will have a lower
            time on page than Version A. I believe we will prove this hypothesis
            because of the highlight and border around each different
            appointment, making it easy to tell which buttons belong to which
            appointment
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="metric">
          <h3>3. Mouse Move Distance</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Null Hypothesis:</strong> Version A will have a very similar
            average mouse move distance as Version B. I believe we will reject
            this because I think mouse move distance will be correlated with the
            amount of user confusion, as they might go to click on option but
            then realize that they need to click another.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Alternative Hypothesis:</strong> Version B will have a lower
            average mouse move distance than Version A. I believe this because
            the changes made to Version B allow for less confusion when finding
            an appointment, leading to fewer mistakes or misclicks, therefore
            less distance moved by the mouse.

      <div id="statistical-analysis">
        <h2>Statistical Analysis Results</h2>
        <div class="analysis-item">
          <h3>Misclick Rate Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            We will use a chi squared test because we are checking how often the
            users of version A misclicked versus how often the users of version
            B misclicked. Since a user can misclick or not misclick (true or
            false), this is categorical data.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Chi-Squared:</strong> 8.710, <strong>P-Value:</strong> .003.
          </p>
          <p>
            We reject the null hypothesis, since with a p-value less than or
            equal to 0.05, we can say that there is a statistically significant
            difference between the two datasets, specifically that there were a
            lot less misclicks in Version B than Version A due to the high
            chi-squared value.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="analysis-item">
          <h3>Time on Page Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            We will use a one-tailed t test since the time on page is a
            continuous variable and we are looking to see that version B has a
            <strong>lower</strong> average time than version A.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>T-Score:</strong> -4.512, <strong>P-Value:</strong> .0001,
            <strong>Version A Avg:</strong> 25865ms,
            <strong>Version B Avg:</strong> 8503ms.
          </p>
          <p>
            We reject the null hypothesis, since with a p-value less than or
            equal to 0.05, we can confidently say that there is a significant
            statistical difference between the two versions, with the T-score
            implying that Version B is lower than Version A. We can see this is
            the case with A’s average time on page being 25865ms while B’s is
            8503ms. A is over 3 times as long as B is.

        </div>

        <div class="analysis-item">
          <h3>Mouse Move Distance Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            We will use a one-tailed t test again since distance moved is a
            continuous variable and we are hoping to find that version B has a
            <strong>lower</strong> average distance than version A.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>T-Score:</strong> -3.372, <strong>P-Value:</strong> .002,
            <strong>Version A Avg:</strong> 7337,
            <strong>Version B Avg:</strong> 2683.
          </p>
          <p>
            We reject the null hypothesis, since with a p-value less than or
            equal to 0.05, we can confidently say that there is a significant
            statistical difference between the two versions, with the T-score
            implying that Version B is lower than Version A. We can see this is
            the case with A’s average mouse move distance being 7337 while B’s
            is 2683. A is almost 3 times as long as B is.

      <div id="summary">
        <h2>Summary and Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
          Since we are able to reject the null hypothesis on all three chosen
          metrics, we can say with high levels of confidence that Version B
          creates a more streamlined and user-friendly experience compared to
          Version A. Version B has an almost perfect no misclick rate while
          Version A has almost 50% misclick rate. In both time on page and mouse
          move distance, Version A's mean was about 3x as long as Version B's
          mean.
